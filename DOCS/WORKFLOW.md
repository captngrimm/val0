# VAL0 WORKFLOW (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

This project is operated by a non-coder operator.
Therefore:

## 1. Code Rules
- No piecemeal edits.
- No "change this function".
- No inline suggestions.
- All code changes are FULL FILE REPLACEMENTS only.

## 2. Delivery Rules
- Anything meant for the VPS is delivered as COPY-PASTE blocks.
- No nano, no vim, no sed unless explicitly requested.
- If a file must exist beforehand, that is stated explicitly.

## 3. Change Rules
- One feature at a time.
- Each feature ends with:
  - Test
  - Commit
  - Git tag

## 4. Chat Rules
- One chat = one mission.
- If context is lost, we STOP and rehydrate from DOCS.
- VPS is the source of truth, not chat memory.

## 5. Failure Mode
If confusion appears:
STOP.
DO NOT PATCH.
ROLL BACK to last tag.
Re-evaluate.

This workflow exists to prevent burnout, drift, and false progress.
