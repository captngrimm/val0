Context:
- Built VFMS v0 end-to-end.
- Ingested large Dell / Data Domain corpus.
- Validated grounded extract + summarize.

What worked:
- Manual pipeline is solid.
- Grounded summaries prevent hallucination.
- VFMS is usable under pressure.

What hurt:
- Cost/benefit doubts during large corpus work.
- Query specificity matters a lot.

Open loops:
- Memory system just started.
- Interpreter mode not built.
- PNG OCR deferred.

Emotional state:
- Tired but clear-headed.
- Momentum regained.

Notes:
- Do not automate memory yet.
