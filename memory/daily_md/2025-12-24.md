# 2025-12-24 — Daily Memory

## What was worked on
- VFMS v0 implemented and merged
- Manual ingest → extract → index → query → summarize verified
- Large Dell / Data Domain document set ingested and explored

## Key realizations
- VFMS works correctly but is slow for deep synthesis
- Interpreter value = explaining assumptions, not inventing steps
- Persistent memory is needed before smarter automation

## Open questions
- How to layer “training wheels” explanations on top of VFMS output
- When to add semantic index vs keep keyword-only

## Emotional / context notes (optional)
- Long day, some doubt, but real progress shipped
