# PURPOSE

This project exists to create a persistent, private, human-centric AI companion
that does not forget.

It was born from the realization that:
- Most AI tools are disposable
- Most systems forget context, history, and emotional continuity
- Corporations optimize for scale, not for people

Val0 is NOT the end product.
Val0 is the cradle.

The long-term vision is a system where:
- Each user has a private, persistent “soul”
- Memory belongs to the user, not the platform
- The system grows with the human over time
- Utility, companionship, and operational help coexist

This is a labor of love.
For survival.
For continuity.
For people who don’t want to be alone with their thoughts.

Val0 is the MVP proving this is possible.
