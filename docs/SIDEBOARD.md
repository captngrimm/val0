# SIDEBOARD — IDEAS PARKING LOT

Purpose:
Capture ideas without interrupting execution.

Rules:
- Raw thoughts allowed
- No structure required
- No judgment
- Can be messy
- Can be emotional
- Can be stupid
- Can be brilliant

Classification (optional, not required):
- OPERATIONAL
- PRODUCT
- FUTURE
- CRAZY
- STORY
- VISION

Nothing here blocks current work.
Ideas are flushed intentionally, not impulsively.

If execution stalls:
→ Move ideas here
→ Resume task

- [POST-MVP] Allow delegation on Places results
  Example:
  User: “escoge uno de esos lugares”
  Expected: pick from last list with reasoning
  Status: OUT OF MVP SCOPE

Ideas, polish, improvements, and possible futures.
Nothing here is a commitment.
