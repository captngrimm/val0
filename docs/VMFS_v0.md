Val File / Forge Memory System — Version 0

## Definition
VFMS v0 is a minimal system designed to:
- receive files
- extract text
- index content
- allow directed retrieval

VFMS does not think. It remembers.

## v0 Scope (what it DOES)
- Manual file ingestion (PDF, text, images)
- OCR when applicable
- Basic indexing (text + metadata)
- On-demand search
- Generation of summaries or Markdown documents on request

## Recognized phases
- Phase 0: VFMS v0 (current)
- Phase 1: automatic tagging and cross-context
- Phase 2: analysis, contradiction detection, alerts

Only Phase 0 exists today.

## What VFMS v0 does NOT do
- No decision-making
- No recommendations
- No prioritization of information
- No user pattern learning
- No autonomous background execution
- No emotional memory mixing
- No agent behavior

## Golden rule
If it cannot be explained in 30 seconds,
it does not belong in v0.
