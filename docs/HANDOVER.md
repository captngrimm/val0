# HANDOVER — READ THIS TO TAKE THE CHAIR

You do not need prior context.

Start here:
1. Read PURPOSE in this repo.
2. Read OPERATING RULES.
3. Follow NEXT_ACTIONS.

If something is unclear:
- Do NOT improvise.
- Add a note to docs/QUESTIONS.md.

This system survives by written continuity, not memory.
