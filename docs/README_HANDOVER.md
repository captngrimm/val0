# VAL0 — HANDOVER & SOURCE OF TRUTH

NOTE: “VAL0” is a technical placeholder. Public/product naming is intentionally undecided.

## PURPOSE (READ FIRST)

This repository is the **single source of truth** for VAL0.

If a chat is lost, reset, or migrated:
- This folder restores context.
- These documents prevent drift.
- This is how continuity survives.

VAL0 is:
- A persistent AI system with memory.
- Operated today via Telegram.
- Designed to migrate to local hardware (“Forge”) later.
- Built for **zero-forgetting**, privacy-first operation.

This repo is authoritative over any chat.

## OPERATING RULES

1. The VPS filesystem overrides any chat memory.
2. If chat advice conflicts with this repo, the repo wins.
3. No assumptions: everything important must exist as a file.
4. No silent changes: edits are logged in docs.
5. Copy-paste beats “understanding code”.
